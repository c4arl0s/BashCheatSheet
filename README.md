# The Difference Between Soft and Hard Links

##Â Hard links

- Only link to a file not a directory
- Can not reference a file on a different disk/volume
- Links will reference a file even if it is moved
- Links reference inode/physical locations on the disk

# Symbolic (soft) links

- Can link to directories
- Can reference a file/folder on a different hard disk/volume
- Links remain if the original file is deleted
- Links will NOT reference the file anymore if it is moved
- Links reference abstract filenames/directories and NOT physical locations. They are given their own inode

Example 1:
```bash
$ ln -s /Users/carlossantiagocruz/Documents/BASH-PROGRAMMING/DICT-EN-ES/trad3.sh /usr/local/bin/trad3
```
Example 2:
```bash
ln -s /Users/carlossantiagocruz/Documents/BASH-PROGRAMMING/MOVER-PDF-2-DIRECTORIO/mover-pdf2directorio.sh /usr/local/bin/mover-pdf2directorio1.0
